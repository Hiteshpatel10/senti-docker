"This is a really nice example, but you ought to check out the Jefferson Golden Hour clock. It uses a counterweight so that neither hand has to be attached to the bezel or mechanism at all. They're quite elegant and you don't see anything moving since it's all actually hidden. They were in production from 1949 until 1991; my parents received one as a wedding gift in 1954 and I still have it, plus a couple more, as well as a few examples of the other clocks in the Jefferson lineup.

I like it. I am wondering if you can take it a bit further and add a metal seconds hand and do the same thing gearing the magnet with the minutes hand. Making it a bit more of a floating realism effect? Maybe add lighting so the the effect looks more real to everyone that its floating in mid air. what a allusion.

"cute ""time-lapse"" that is clearly cut numerous times to make the home made clock appear to be ""perfectly accurate"". when you demoed it in the clip before, the minute hand had a smooth motion yet it spontaneously became herkie jerky for the time-lapse. and if you watch closely, the standard clock hitches every time a minute passes. I'm sure if you spent more time on finessing the clock you built you could actually have a wonderfully smooth result, but due to your lack of pride in your craftsmanship you posed a shoddy result as a ""flawless"" piece.",2023-02-15T07:18:19Z,NK Stallion,0,0

"one way to make the minute hand looks ""disconnect"" (no touching the outer circle) is to attach the minute hand to an acrylic round gear (as big as the outer circle) and rotate the whole gear with the minute hand attached to it. 
With the big round gear as a clear background, it will be hard to notice the rotation",2023-02-14T13:33:50Z,Thành Vinh Lê,2,2

"First of all, this is a very cool end result and really nice of you to share it with us. I watched it and was moved to think about how I could do similar things, and it was informative about the steps involved and had a pleasant end result.  So my concerns below are about replicating the same project in my own life:

It's pretty cool that it is possible to order a PCB board starting at $0 if someone has the time to design it themselves.  For the part where you design a gerber file for a custom PCB -  for someone who's never designed a gerber file like me, and has other responsibilities and doesn't yet know electronics, I looked up how many hours it would take to get to the level of competence to do this without any outsourcing, and it seems to be about 160-240 which is about 4-8 weeks full time.  It it possible for anyone to learn these skills if they have the time to fit it into their life.

In my case I would be inclined to use Fiverr to speed up the custom PCB creation step which is not an option right now, however I think it is important to be realistic and strategically work with other designers such as on CAD files for 3D printing and on PCB design.  The idea itself is really cool, and I am impressed by the finished product and thankful that you shared it.",2023-02-14T04:51:23Z,Robert Viragh,0,0

"Mind blown!!! 

Recently I saw a similar looking ring-clock but in a more classic fassion: there was a static vertical bar comming from the top of the ring to the center, holding a regular clock mechanism. When I saw it I thought it would be awesome if the minute hand was actually connected to the ring and moving, with an adjusted mechanism for the hour hand on the ""center end"" of the minute hand - a few days later I see this in my Recommended list :D

"I'm wondering if there's a way to make both hands magnetic, or if the magnetic fields will just be too likely to overlap whenever the minute hand passes over the hour hand. Maybe with a buffer zone between the two... but then, of course, you'd need something else to hold up the center point, negating the premise of the ""hollow"" clock. I mean, it's still pretty impressive looking even if you use a clear background, you just can't put your hand through it... But then, if both hands used magnets, you could completely hide the mechanical workings of the clock (right now, you can still see the circles turning if you know where to look).

I'm might be having way too much fun backseat engineering this clock, heh. The current product is amazingly cool as is, it's just that to my brain, once I saw the magnet solution for the hour hand... whelp.",2023-02-13T03:46:19Z,"Karin [CAR-in, not CARE-en]",0,1

"Hey! Wrench I love watching your videos, and I am also kept creating such DIY stuff inspired by you the thing is nowadays I am planning to mod and convert my old boring pc cabinet to a very interesting and my most favourite theme that is IRONMAN theme pc cabinet and I actually have planned everything very nicely, the place where I stuck is that I want a miniature of an ARC-REACTOR at the front side of my cabinet which should look similar to the one in the movies and also glows like the same bluish color whenever I want. Some miniatures are actually available at online sites but they are not like same or either so costly, so its my request that please can you help me with some of your views and ideas with this and creating an ARC-REACTOR which is non-3d printed, cheap cost ,looks and glows same, easily usable, less problematic. Thank you. LOVE YOU 3000💙💛❤.",2023-02-10T08:51:24Z,AADI 2oo4,37,0
